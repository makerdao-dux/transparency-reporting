Balance accumulated on Payment provider:

- EUR: 191.88
- USD: 5,565.55

  The balance accumulated on the payment provider is surplus generated from transforming from DAI to EUR/USD based on the current market prices. The balance is not on the core unit wallet but held on the payment provider side used as a health buffer for payments. The core unit will adjust payments to the payment provider to keep this balance around 2,000 DAI.
